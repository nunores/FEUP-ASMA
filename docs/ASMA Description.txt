>>>> Air Traffic Control <<<<

Air traffic control is a tough job and our project intends to ease all of this
process. Each airplane has its own remaining fuel, a 
minimum time and space required to land, and the airport has different
priorities based on the company of the airplane, potential emergencies
and the number of passengers. 
The number of runways are scarce and the aim is to make the best use of them. 
We intend to develop a MAS-based to solve this problem of allocating
airstrips to aircrafts. This allocation should be dynamic, 
through negotiation between agents.

Dependent Variables:
	- Waiting Times
	- Airstrip Allocation / Occupation
	- Fuel Used
Independent Variables:
	- Starting Fuel
	- Minimum time to land each aircraft
	- Minimum space to land each aircraft
	- Number of Airstrips
