Our agent-based model will involve animals that compete in a shared, grid-like environment with the purpose of simulating
natural selection.
This environment will contain randomly placed food that is eaten by those animals. 
They use energy to travel, walking randomly through the grid and eating the food they find on their path.
Based on the amount of food found, they may survive, die or reproduce.
Upon reproduction, the animals mutate and propagate their traits like speed and size.

The simulation would enable the observation of the population and the dominance of each trait. 

The tool we're gonna be using for development is Mesa.
